## Background

A short background on me: as of June 2023 (when I started this project), I will be going to college in the fall at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Once I arrive, one of my goals is to become a fraternity DJ. With four months of experience under my belt, I have realized that the significant majority of DJs never progress beyond a few certain core skills (on which I will later elaborate), and certainly for the purposes of frat parties, a DJ needs only to be lower-intermediate -- **at best**. For a while, I had been wondering if I could use machine learning (ML) to create an Artificial-Intelligence (AI) DJ. Discussing this with my dad over tacos during our vacation to Toronto, he actually suggested the idea independently, and we went into depth on the topic.

Inspired by these new ideas as well as my plan to conduct AI-Music Research in [Professor Julian McAuley's lab](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) at UCSD (largely under his PhD student Zachary Novack, if anyone was wondering), I decided I would try to create my own AI DJ. Though I thought Spotify had already managed to do it, their AI DJ is a bit different, and instead of generating a seamless mix from a playlist of songs, it really just provides [commentary between songs](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-02-22/spotify-debuts-a-new-ai-dj-right-in-your-pocket/). What follows is an outline of the steps I plan to take to tackle this challenge (a *gameplan*, per se).
